# Appendix A: Glossary and Indexes

[← Previous: Evolution](./09-evolution.md) | [Index](./00-index.md#table-of-contents) | [Next: References →](./appendix-b-references.md)

---

This appendix applies to **Sections 1 through 9** of this RFC.

It introduces **no new behavior**. Its purpose is **reference, traceability,
and longevity**.

---

## A.1 Glossary of Terms

This glossary defines terms **as used in this RFC**, not in general industry
usage.

---

### Authority

A system that is the **single source of truth** for a given piece of data at
a given phase. At no time MAY more than one authority exist for the same
secret.

---

### Bootstrap Secret

A temporary secret required to bring the system to a state where a runtime
authority can exist.

Bootstrap secrets:

- exist before the runtime authority,
- MUST be encrypted in Git,
- MUST NOT be rotated automatically,
- and MUST be retired after handover.

---

### Runtime Secret

A secret owned by the runtime authority after bootstrap.

Runtime secrets:

- are rotated automatically,
- MUST NOT be stored in Git,
- and are lifecycle-managed by the system.

---

### Derived Secret

A secret generated by infrastructure or controllers (e.g., databases, storage
systems) and pushed into the runtime authority.

---

### Internal Secret *(v1.1)*

A secret generated by an operator or controller within the same Kubernetes
cluster, requiring distribution to consumers in other namespaces.

Internal secrets:

- are generated within the cluster boundary,
- MUST traverse Vault via PushSecret/ExternalSecret pattern,
- are lifecycle-managed by the generating operator.

See [Section 5a](./05a-internal-distribution.md).

---

### Internal Configuration *(v1.1)*

Non-sensitive configuration data (endpoints, ports, connection parameters)
generated or managed within the cluster that requires cross-namespace
distribution.

Internal configuration:

- MAY use the same PushSecret/ExternalSecret pattern as secrets,
- MUST use separate Vault paths (`platform-config/` vs `platform-data/`),
- is NOT a security boundary.

See [Section 5a](./05a-internal-distribution.md).

---

### PushSecret *(v1.1)*

A Kubernetes custom resource (external-secrets.io/v1alpha1) that watches a
source Secret and syncs selected keys to the runtime authority (Vault).

PushSecret enables the publication phase of internal secret distribution.

See [Section 5a.3](./05a-internal-distribution.md#5a3-distribution-framework).

---

### Platform Data Path *(v1.1)*

The standardized Vault path prefix for internal secrets:
`platform-data/{datasource}/{consumer}`.

See [Section 5a.5](./05a-internal-distribution.md#5a5-vault-path-conventions).

---

### Platform Config Path *(v1.1)*

The standardized Vault path prefix for internal configuration:
`platform-config/{datasource}/{instance}`.

See [Section 5a.5](./05a-internal-distribution.md#5a5-vault-path-conventions).

---

### Secret Publication Layer *(v1.1)*

A data plane component responsible for watching source secrets in producer
namespaces and pushing selected data to the runtime authority.

The publication layer bridges operator-generated secrets to the centralized
authority without transferring ownership.

See [Section 4.3.8](./04-components.md#438-secret-publication-layer-v11).

---

### Runtime Secret Authority

The system responsible for:

- storing secret values,
- enforcing access control,
- tracking metadata and expiry,
- and executing rotation.

Kubernetes is **NEVER** the runtime authority.

---

### Materialized Secret

A Kubernetes Secret derived from the runtime authority and consumed by
workloads.

Materialized secrets are:

- disposable,
- replaceable,
- never authoritative.

---

### Handover

The explicit, one-time transfer of authority from bootstrap secrets to the
runtime authority.

Handover MUST be:

- observable,
- auditable,
- idempotent.

---

### Rotation

The controlled replacement of a secret value according to a policy.

Rotation is:

- runtime-owned,
- automated,
- independent of Git.

---

### Control Plane

Any system that decides *what SHOULD exist*.

Examples:

- Git repository
- GitOps controller
- Orchestration engine

---

### Data Plane

Any system that holds or serves *actual values*.

Examples:

- Runtime secret authority
- Kubernetes Secrets (materialized only)

---

### Root of Trust

The minimal cryptographic material that anchors the entire system.

This exists **outside Kubernetes** and is established once.

---

## A.2 Architecture Decision Record (ADR) Index

This index summarizes **key architectural decisions**, their rationale, and
where they are defined.

---

### ADR-001 — Secrets Are First-Class Resources

- **Decision**: Secrets MUST be explicitly modeled with lifecycle and ownership.
- **Rationale**: Implicit secrets do not scale or audit.
- **Defined In**: [Section 2](./02-requirements.md)

---

### ADR-002 — Git Is Source of Intent, Not Value

- **Decision**: Git defines existence and policy, not runtime values.
- **Rationale**: Rotation and TTL cannot be Git-driven.
- **Defined In**: [Section 2](./02-requirements.md), [Section 6](./06-rotation.md)

---

### ADR-003 — Vault-First, Kubernetes-Second

- **Decision**: Kubernetes consumes secrets; it MUST NOT own them.
- **Rationale**: Kubernetes lacks lifecycle semantics.
- **Defined In**: [Section 2](./02-requirements.md), [Section 5](./05-mechanics.md)

---

### ADR-004 — Explicit Bootstrap Phase

- **Decision**: Bootstrap secrets are temporary and transitional.
- **Rationale**: The bootstrap paradox MUST be modeled explicitly.
- **Defined In**: [Section 3](./03-architecture.md), [Section 5](./05-mechanics.md)

---

### ADR-005 — No Git Involvement in Rotation

- **Decision**: Rotation MUST NOT require Git commits.
- **Rationale**: Runtime behavior MUST be autonomous.
- **Defined In**: [Section 6](./06-rotation.md)

---

### ADR-006 — Orchestration Over Scripts

- **Decision**: All sequencing MUST be declarative and observable.
- **Rationale**: Scripts create hidden control planes.
- **Defined In**: [Section 4](./04-components.md), [Section 6](./06-rotation.md), [Section 8](./08-rationale.md)

---

### ADR-007 — Single Authority at Any Time

- **Decision**: Authority MUST be singular and explicit.
- **Rationale**: Dual authority creates ambiguity and failure.
- **Defined In**: [Section 2](./02-requirements.md), [Section 5](./05-mechanics.md), [Section 7](./07-security.md)

---

### ADR-008 — Cluster Independence

- **Decision**: Each cluster is autonomous.
- **Rationale**: Limits blast radius and simplifies recovery.
- **Defined In**: [Section 9](./09-evolution.md)

---

### ADR-009 — Internal Secrets MUST Traverse Vault *(v1.1)*

- **Decision**: Cross-namespace internal secrets MUST use PushSecret → Vault → ExternalSecret.
- **Rationale**: Direct namespace copying violates single-authority principle and loses audit trail.
- **Defined In**: [Section 2](./02-requirements.md) (Invariant 7), [Section 5a](./05a-internal-distribution.md), [Section 8.10](./08-rationale.md#810-why-vault-as-intermediary-for-cross-namespace-distribution-v11)

---

### ADR-010 — Configuration MAY Use Same Distribution Path *(v1.1)*

- **Decision**: Non-sensitive configuration MAY use the same PushSecret/ExternalSecret pattern.
- **Rationale**: Centralizes discovery and management; NOT a security boundary.
- **Defined In**: [Section 2](./02-requirements.md) (Invariant 8), [Section 5a](./05a-internal-distribution.md)
