# Container Orchestration Module

Hosts pluggable providers that turn provisioned infrastructure into Kubernetes clusters. Each provider lives under `providers/<name>/` with `deploy.sh`, `reset.sh`, and `validate.sh` entrypoints consuming inventories generated by the `api` CLI. Current MVP provider: `kubespray` (migrated from the legacy `k8s-cluster` and `kubernetes` directories). Stubs for additional providers should follow the same contract.

## Usage

```bash
./api/bin/api generate env --id development --config core   # produces inventory + group vars
cd container-orchestration/providers/kubespray
./deploy.sh --env development
```

Providers must read configuration from `container-orchestration/environments/<env>.yaml` (which references a config package) and should never mutate API outputs directly.
