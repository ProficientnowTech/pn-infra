# Docs Module

Centralizes architectural references, runbooks, validation notes, and the `fuma-docs` site that will ultimately be hosted via the platform. Each document lives under `docs/<topic>/`. The `docs/fuma-docs` directory holds the scaffold for the documentation application (Helm/Argo manifests, content stubs).

Key subdirectories:\n+- `docs/general/`: high-level guides\n+- `docs/platform/*`: stack-specific procedures\n+- `docs/fuma-docs/`: documentation site deployed via the business module\n*** End Patch*** End Patch}?
